The OWASP iGoat project is a security learning tool for iOS developers to learn about security weaknesses in iOS -- by breaking things as well as fixing them.

iGoat is available **ONLY** in source code format, and this is the official repository for that code.

On the **Downloads** tab here, you will find the full iGoat source tree in tar format, or you can go to the **Source** tab for instructions on using Mercurial to grab (or clone) the source tree.

Be sure to also check out the **Wiki** tab here for useful documents related to the iGoat project.
