**Q1:** Do I need to be an Apple iOS Developer to use iGoat?

**A1:** No, you don't! You can get Xcode for free from the Mac App Store, and run it entirely for free via the iPhone Simulator (included with Xcode). Of course, if you want to run iGoat on a physical iOS device, you'll need to sign up for Apple's iOS Developer program, but that is **NOT** required.

**Q2:** I keep getting "server errors" when I run the Authentication exercise. What's up with that?

**A2:** Two of iGoat's exercises, Authentication and Server Communications, require a server component. The server is included in the ~igoat/server directory. You'll need to run the server prior to being able to perform the exercises. The server is a very (!) lightweight service, written in Ruby, and it runs on a stock Mac. You will, however, need to install a couple of Ruby Gems -- see the README in the server folder for info.

**Q3:** How do I get involved with the iGoat project?

**A3:** Thanks for volunteering! There's always plenty of things that need to be done. Best thing to do to get started is to work through every iGoat exercise and be sure you're able to implement the solutions properly. That'll help you get acquainted with the code and how it's laid out. Next, look at our Wish List wiki page here and see what tasks need to be done. If there's one there that suits your skills and interests, _contact me_ and let's talk. If there isn't a task on that list that appeals to you, _contact me_ and let's talk about other ideas. And, of course, if you have your own idea of what you'd like to work on, _contact me_ and let's talk.
