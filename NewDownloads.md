# Introduction #

Since Google deprecated the Downloads feature in Google Code (see http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html), we've created a Google Drive page for downloading iGoat. Same files and all, but now on a different page.


# Details #

To download current version of iGoat, you can do either of the following:

1) Select the Source tab here, then select Changes, and then click on "Download ZIP". This will download the currently committed source tree, which may include changes that have not yet been released.


2) Refer to the downloads page here to download a single ZIP file containing the entire source tree:
